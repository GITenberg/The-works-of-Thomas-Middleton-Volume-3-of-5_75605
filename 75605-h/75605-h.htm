<p class='c014'>This drama (both First and Second Parts) ought to have
occupied an earlier station among our author’s works. I originally
rejected it, because the name of Dekker alone appears

such authority for ascribing a portion of it to Middleton as
that of Henslowe in the following entry, I should not be justified
in excluding it from the present collection:</p>

laughter.</p>

<p class='c022 prose'><span class='sc'>Cas.</span> Truth, I have a pretty sportive conceit new

<p class='c022 prose'><span class='sc'>Pio.</span> Let’s ha’t, let’s ha’t; and where shall the
scene of mirth lie?</p>

<p class='c022 prose'><span class='sc'>Cas.</span> At signor Candido’s house, the patient man,
nay, the monstrous patient man: they say his blood
is immoveable; that he has taken all patience from
a man, and all constancy from a woman.</p>

<p class='c022 prose'><span class='sc'>Flu.</span> That makes so many whores now-a-days.</p>

<p class='c022 prose'><span class='sc'>Cas.</span> Ay, and so many knaves too.</p>

<p class='c022 prose'><span class='sc'>Pio.</span> Well, sir.</p>

<p class='c022 prose'><span class='sc'>Cas.</span> To conclude,—the report goes, he’s so mild,
so affable, so suffering, that nothing indeed can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>move him: now do but think what sport it will
be to make this fellow, the mirror of patience, as
angry, as vexed, and as mad as an English cuckold.</p>

<p class='c022 prose'><span class='sc'>Flu.</span> O, 'twere admirable mirth that! but how
will’t be done, signor?</p>

<p class='c022 prose'><span class='sc'>Cas.</span> Let me alone; I have a trick, a conceit, a
thing, a device will sting him, i’faith, if he have but
a thimbleful of blood in’s belly, or a spleen not so
big as a tavern-token.<a id='r41'></a><a href='#f41' class='c013'><sup>[41]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c022 prose'><span class='sc'>Pio.</span> Thou stir him, thou move him, thou anger
him? alas, I know his approved temper! thou
vex him? why, he has a patience above man’s injuries;
thou mayest sooner raise a spleen in an
angel than rough humour in him. Why, I’ll give
you instance for it. This wonderfully tempered signor
Candido upon a time invited home to his house
certain Neapolitan lords of curious taste and no
mean palates, conjuring his wife, of all loves,<a id='r42'></a><a href='#f42' class='c013'><sup>[42]</sup></a> to
prepare cheer fitting for such honourable trenchermen.
She—just of a woman’s nature, covetous to
try the uttermost of vexation, and thinking at last
to get the start of his humour—willingly neglected
the preparation, and became unfurnished not only
of dainty, but of ordinary dishes. He, according
to the mildness of his breast, entertained the lords,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>and with courtly discourse beguiled the time, as
much as a citizen might do. To conclude: they
were hungry lords, for there came no meat in; their
stomachs were plainly gulled, and their teeth deluded;
and, if anger could have seized a man, there
was matter enough, i’faith, to vex any citizen in the
world, if he were not too much made a fool by his
wife.</p>

<p class='c022 prose'><span class='sc'>Flu.</span> Ay, I’ll swear for’t: ’sfoot, had it been my
case, I should ha’ played mad tricks with my wife
and family; first, I would ha’ spitted the men,
stewed the maids, and baked the mistress, and so
served them in.</p>

  <h2 class='c011'>THE HONEST WHORE. <br> <br>(PART SECOND.)</h2>
</div>

<p class='c030'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span><i>The Second Part of the Honest Whore, With the Humors of
the Patient Man, the Impatient Wife: the Honest Whore, perswaded
by strong Arguments to turne Curtizan againe: her braue
refuting those Arguments. And lastly, the Comicall Passages of
an Italian Bridewell, where the Scæne ends. Written by Thomas
Dekker. London, Printed by Elizabeth All-de, for Nathaniel
Butter, An. Dom. 1630.</i> 4to.</p>

<p class='c031'>No earlier impression than that of 1630 is known to exist.
It has been reprinted in the second and third editions of
Dodsley’s <i>Old Plays</i>, vol. iii.; and, as there given, is perhaps
the most wretchedly edited drama in the English language.</p>

<p class='c032'>It was licensed by Sir George Bucke, 29th April, 1608:
see Chalmers’s <i>Suppl. Apol.</i> p. 202 (where it is by mistake
called “the <i>convicted</i>,” instead of the “converted Courtisan,
or Honest Whore”). As Middleton certainly wrote a portion
of the First Part of this play (see p. 3 of the present vol.),
there is every reason to believe that he was concerned in the
composition of the Second Part.</p>

<p class='c032'>Because the title-page makes no mention of its having been
represented on the stage, Langbaine very unnecessarily concludes
that it was never acted. “The passage,” he continues,
“between the Patient Man and his Impatient Wife’s going
to fight for the Breeches, with the happy Event, is exprest
by S<sup>r</sup>. John Harrington in Verse. See his Epigrams at the
end of <i>Orlando Furioso</i>, Book 1. Epigr. 16.” <i>Acc. of Engl.
Dram. Poets</i>, p. 122. The epigram in question is as follows:</p>

      <div class='line'>To-morrow, at Cuckolds hauen, I’le prepare me.</div>
      <div class='line'>Peace, wife, said he, wee’le cease all rage and rancor,</div>
      <div class='line'>Ere in that Harbor I will ride at Ancor.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c032'>“Although Harington’s Epigrams,” says the last editor of
Dodsley’s <i>Old Plays</i>, “were not printed in an entire state
until 1618 (see Ritson’s <i>Bibl. Poet.</i> 236), yet many of them
were written when their author (who died in 1612) was a very
young man. It seems probable that the incident was founded
upon the epigram; for though Sir John Harington borrowed
from the Latin and Italian, he most likely would not steal
from an English play, especially when it appears that his originality
had been attacked.”</p>

  <h2 class='c011'>THE WITCH.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c030'><span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span><i>A Tragi-Coomodie, called The Witch; Long since acted by His
Ma<sup>ties</sup> Servants at the Black-Friers. Written by Tho. Middleton.</i></p>

<p class='c031'>The MS., from which this drama is now given, forms part
of Malone’s Collection in the Bodleian Library, Oxford. In
1778 a small impression of <i>The Witch</i> was printed by Isaac
Reed, for distribution among his friends: it was intended
to exhibit the original text <i>verbatim et literatim</i>; but from a
collation which was obligingly made for me by the Rev.
Stephen Reay, I find that it is not without some errors and
omissions.</p>

<p class='c032'>On the disputed question, whether this drama was composed
before or after the appearance of Shakespeare’s <i>Macbeth</i>, see
the Account of Middleton and his writings.</p>

<p class='c032'>Some of the incidents in <i>The Witch</i> were suggested by the
following passage of Machiavel’s <i>Florentine History</i>. “Their
[the Lombards’] kingdom descending upon Alboinus a bold
and warlike man, they passed the Danube, and encountering
Comundus King of the Lepides then possessed of Pannonia,
overthrew and slew him. Amongst the captives Alboinus
finds Rosamund the daughter of Comundus, and taking her
to wife becomes Lord of Pannonia; but out of a brutish fierceness
in his nature, he makes a drinking cup of Comundus’s
skull, and out of it used to carouse in memory of that victory.
Invited now by Narsetes, with whom he had been in league
during the Gothick war, he leaves Pannonia to the Huns, who,
as we have said, were after the death of Attila returned into
their own Countrey, and comes into Italy, which finding so
strangely divided, he in an instant possesses himself of Pavia,
Milan, Verona, Vicenza, all Tuscany, and the greatest part
of Flaminia, at this day called Romania. So that by these
great and sudden victories judging himself already Conquerour
of Italy, he makes a solemn feast at Verona, and in
the heat of wine growing merry, causes Comundus’s skull to
be filled full of wine, and would needs have it presented to
Queen Rosamund, who sate at table over against him, telling
her so loud that all might hear, that in such a time of mirth
he would have her drink with her father; those words were
as so many darts in the poor ladies bosome, and consulting
with revenge, she bethought her self, how Almachildis a noble
Lombard, young and valiant, courted one of the Ladies of her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>bed-chamber; with her she contrives that she should promise
Almachildis the kindness of admitting him by night to her
chamber; and Almachildis according to her assignation being
received into a dark room, lyes with the Queen, whilest he
thought he lay with the Lady, who after the fact discovers
herself, offering to his choice either the killing of Alboinus
and enjoying her and the Crown, or the being made his sacrifice
for defiling his bed. Almachildis consents to kill Alboinus;
but they seeing afterwards their designs of seizing the kingdom
prove unsuccessful, nay rather fearing to be put to death
by the Lombards (such love bore they to Alboinus) they fled
with all the Royal Treasure to Longinus at Ravenna,” &#38;c.

<p class='c041'><span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span><i>The Widdow A Comedie. As it was Acted at the private House
in Black-Fryers, with great Applause, by His late Majesties
Servants.</i></p>

<p class='c0mlctr'><span class='multiline'><i>Written by</i> <span class='xxlarge'>{</span></span> <span class='multiline'><i>Ben: Johnson.</i><br><i>John Fletcher.</i><br><i>Tho: Middleton.</i></span> <span class='multiline'><span class='xxlarge'>}</span> <i>Gent.</i></span></p>

<p class='c042'><i>Printed by the Originall Copy. London, Printed for Humphrey
Moseley and are to be Sold at his Shop, at the Sign of the Princes
Arms in St. Pauls Church-yard.</i> 1652. 4to.</p>

<p class='c043'>On the title-page of a copy of the 4to, in my possession,
“<i>Ben: Johnson</i>” and “<i>John Fletcher</i>” are drawn through with
a pen, and the word “alone” is written, in an old hand, after
“<i>Tho: Middleton</i>.”</p>

<p class='c042'>This drama has been reprinted in the various editions of
Dodsley’s <i>Old Plays</i> (vol. vi. of the first ed. and vol. xii. of
the last two eds.); also in Weber’s edition of Beaumont and
Fletcher’s <i>Works</i>, vol. xiv.</p>

<p class='c042'>Malone, by mistake, has stated that “Middleton wrote <i>The
Widow</i> with Fletcher and <i>Massinger</i>:” <i>Life of Shakespeare</i>,
p. 434—(<i>Sh.</i> by Boswell, vol. ii.)</p>

<p class='c042'>“He [Ben Jonson] is said to have assisted Middleton and
Fletcher in writing <i>The Widow</i>, which must have appeared
about this time [i. e. soon after 1621]. This comedy was very
popular, and not undeservedly, for it has a considerable degree
of merit. I cannot, however, discover many traces of
Jonson in it. The authors’ names rest, I believe, on the
authority of the editor, A. Gough, who sent the play to the
press in 1652.” Such is Gifford’s note on <i>Memoirs of B. Jonson</i>,
p. cxliv. But in a note on Jonson’s <i>New Inn</i> (<i>Works</i>,
vol. v. p. 433), he says, that <i>The Widow</i> “appeared on the
stage so early as 1618.”</p>

<p class='c042'>The last editor of Dodsley’s <i>Old Plays</i> thinks “there is internal
evidence that Ben Jonson contributed to <i>The Widow</i>,
and it is rather surprising that Mr. Gifford did not trace his
pen through the whole of the fourth act.”</p>

<p class='c042'>The mention of “yellow bands” as “<i>hateful</i>” (see act v.
sc. 1, and note), in consequence of Mrs. Turner’s execution,
November 1615, shews that <i>The Widow</i> was written <i>after</i> that
period: but in all probability it was produced <i>very soon after</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>for a play, entitled <i>The Honest Lawyer, by S. S.</i>, and printed
in 1616, contains a manifest imitation of a passage in act iv.
sc. 2: vide note. We can hardly suppose that the author (or
authors) of <i>The Widow</i> would have borrowed from the dramatist
just mentioned.</p>

<p class='c042'>We learn from Sir Henry Herbert’s papers that <i>The Widow</i>
was one of the stock-pieces belonging to the Red Bull actors,
who afterwards became the king’s servants, and that it was
played in 1660: see Malone’s <i>Hist. Acc. of the English Stage</i>,
pp. 273-5 (<i>Shakespeare</i>, by Boswell, vol. iii.). Downes also
mentions that it was performed at a somewhat later period:
vide <i>Roscius Anglicanus</i>, p. 17, ed. Waldron. And Langbaine
says, “It was reviv’d not many years ago, at the King’s
House, with a new Prologue and Epilogue, which the Reader
may find in <i>London Drollery</i>, p. 11, 12.” <i>Acc. of Engl. Dram.
Poets</i>, p. 298.</p>

<p class='c043'>Considering how the curious pay some part of their
esteem to excellent persons in the careful preservation
but of their defaced statues; instead of
decayed medals of the Romans’ greatness, I believed
it of more value to present you this lively piece,
drawn by the art of Jonson, Fletcher, and Middleton,
which is thought to have a near resemblance to
the portraiture we have in Terence of those worthy
minds, where the great Scipio and Lælius strove
to twist the poet’s ivy with the victor’s bays. As
the one was deserved by their work in subduing
their country’s enemies, so the other by their recreation
and delight, which was to banish that folly
and sadness that were worse than Hannibal or all
the monsters and venom of Africa. Since our own
countrymen are not in any thing inferior, it were to
be wished they had but so much encouragement,
that the past license and abuses charged on the
stage might not ever be thought too unpardonable
to pass in oblivion, and so good laws and instructions
for manners, uncapable of being regulated,
which, if but according to this pattern, certainly
none need think himself the less a good Christian
for owning the same desire as</p>

may be read in English in the <i>Complaisant Companion</i>, octavo,

accusing her, is founded on a Novel of Cynthio Giraldi: See

<p class='c051'>’Tis but a play, and a play is but a butt,
against which many shoot many arrows of envy;
’tis the weaker part, and how much more noble
shall it be in you to defend it: yet if it be (as some
philosophers have left behind 'em), that this megacosm,
this great world, is no more than a stage,
where every one must act his part, you shall of
necessity have many partakers, some long, some
short, some indifferent, all some; whilst indeed the
players themselves have the least part of it, for I
know few that have lands (which are a part of the
world), and therefore no grounded men; but howsoever
they serve for mutes, happily they must
wear good clothes for attendance, yet all have exits,
and must all be stript in the tiring-house (viz. the
grave), for none must carry any thing out of the
stock. You see, sir, I write as I speak, and I speak
as I am, and that’s excuse enough for me. I did
not mean to write an epistle of praise to you; it
looks so like a thing I know you love not, flattery,
which you exceedingly hate actively, and unpleasingly
accept passively: indeed, I meant to tell you
your own, that is, that this child of the Muses is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_446'>446</span>yours; whoever begat it, ’tis laid to your charge,
and, for aught I know, you must father and keep
it too: if it please you, I hope you shall not be
ashamed of it neither, for it has been seen, though
I say it, in good companies, and many have said it
is a handsome, pretty-spoken infant. Now be your
own judge; at your leisure look on it, at your
pleasure laugh at it; and if you be sorry it is no
better, you may be glad it is no bigger.</p>

<p class='c022 prose'><span class='sc'>Col.’s Fr.</span> How? shame, sir? is it a shame for
scholars to learn? Sir, there are great scholars
that are but slenderly read in our profession: sir,
first it must be economical, then ecumenical: shame
not to practise in the house how to perform in the
field: the nail that is driven takes a little hold at
the first stroke, but more at the second, and more
at the third, but when ’tis home to the head, then
’tis firm.</p>

and tell me in what language I shall roar a lecture

of roaring.</p>

<p class='c022 prose'><span class='sc'>Chough.</span> Is it mathematical?</p>

roar by nature—and is not the knowledge of these

    <div>“<span class='sc'>To the Reader</span>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c031'>“When these amongst others of Mr. Thomas Middleton’s
excellent poems came to my hands, I was not a little confident
but that his name would prove as great an inducement for
thee to read as me to print them; since those issues of his
brain that have already seen the sun have by their worth
gained themselves a free entertainment amongst all that are
ingenious: and I am most certain that these will no way
lessen his reputation nor hinder his admission to any noble
and recreative spirits. All that I require at thy hands is to
continue the author in his deserved esteem, and to accept of
my endeavours which have ever been to please thee.</p>

<div class='c056'>Farewell.”</div>

<p class='c032'>Another play by Middleton, printed in the same year and
for the same bookseller—<span class='multiline'>No <span class='xlarge'>{</span> <i>Wit</i><br><i>Help</i> <span class='xlarge'>}</span> <i>like a Woman’s</i></span>—is generally
found appended to the volume just
described.</p>

<p class='c032'>The present drama has been reprinted in the 4th vol. of
<i>A Continuation of Dodsley’s Old Plays</i>, 1816.</p>

<p class='c032'>That <i>More Dissemblers besides Women</i> was produced a considerable
time previous to the year 1623, we learn from the
following entry by Sir Henry Herbert (Chalmers’s <i>Suppl. Apol.</i>
p. 215);</p>

<p class='c032'>“17 October [1623] For the King’s Company, <i>An Old
Play, called, More Dissemblers besides Women</i>: allowed by Sir
George Bucke; and being free from alterations was allowed
by me, for a new play, called <i>The Devil of Dowgate, or Usury
put to use</i>. Written by Fletcher.”</p>

<p class='c032'>Immediately preceding act i. of the old ed. are the words
“The First Part;” which would seem to imply that a Second
Part had been written, or perhaps only designed.</p>

Healths used by the Spendalls of this age</i>. ‘He that beginnes
the health hath his prescribed orders: first uncovering his
head, hee takes a full cup in his hand, and setting his countenance
with a grave aspect, hee craves for audience: silence
being once obtained, hee beginnes to breath out the name
peradventure of some honourable personage, that is worthy of
a better regard, then to have his name polluted at so unfitting
a time amongst a company of Drunkards: but his health is
drunke to, and he that pledgeth must likewise off with his
cap, kisse his fingers, and bowing himselfe in signe of a reverent
acceptance; when the Leader sees his follower thus prepared,
hee sups up his broath, turnes the bottom of the cup
upward, and in ostentation of his dexteritie, gives the cup a
phillip to make it cry <i>Twango</i>. And thus the first scene is
acted. The cup being newly replenished to the breadth of an
haire, he that is the pledger must now beginne his part, and
thus it goes round throughout the whole company, provided
alwayes, by a canon set downe by the Founder, there must be
three at the least still uncovered, till the health hath had the
full passage: which is no sooner ended, but another begins

Greene, called <i>Theeves falling out Truemen come by their goods</i>,
printed in 1615, and probably earlier, there is a story entitled
‘The Conversion of an English Curtezan,’ which, in
some points, bears a resemblance to a main incident in this
play. Her conversion is wrought by a young man who visits
her as in ‘the way of her trade:’ at his request she takes him
into a dark loft, under pretence that he cannot bear to commit
‘the act of sin’ in the light; but still the day peeps in through
a hole in the roof: on his complaining that it was not quite
dark, she replies, that ‘none but God could see them.’ Hence
he takes occasion to read her a lecture very similar to that of
Hippolito in Dekker. ‘Oh! thou art made beautiful, fair, and
well formed, and wilt thou then by thy filthy lust make thy
body, which if thou be honest is the temple of God, the habitation
of the Devil?’ In one place he says,—‘But suppose
while thou art young thou art favoured of thy companions;
when thou waxest old, and that thy beauty is faded, then thou
shalt be loathed and despised even of them that professed most
love unto thee.’ After she has been thoroughly reformed, he
marries her.” <span class='sc'>Collier.</span></p>

to the house of Correction which goes by that name in
London. Changing the names of the duke and his son to
those of Henry the Eighth and Edward the Sixth, all the
events mentioned will be found to have happened in the English
Bridewell. The situation of the place is also the same. In
the time of Henry the Eighth princes were lodged there; part
of it being built in the year 1522, for the reception of Charles
the Fifth, whose nobles resided in it. In 1528, Cardinal
Campeius had his first audience there; and after Henry’s
death, Edward the Sixth, in the seventh year of his reign,
1552, gave to the citizens of London this his palace for the
purposes above mentioned. To complete the parallel, it was
endowed with land, late belonging to the Savoy, to the amount
of 700 marks a-year, with all the bedding and furniture of that
hospital. See Stowe’s <cite>Survey</cite>, Strype’s edit. 1721, vol. i. p. 264.

three speeches of Hecate, Middleton follows Reginald Scot,
using sometimes the very words of that curious writer. In the
<i>Discouerie of Witchcraft</i>, Scot gives from “John Bapt. Neap.”
i. e. Porta, the following receipts for the miraculous transportation
of witches: “℞. <i>The fat of yoong children, and seeth
it with water in a brasen vessell</i>, reseruing the thickest of that
which remaineth boiled in the bottome, which they laie vp
and keepe, vntill occasion serueth to vse it. <i>They put herevnto
Eleoselinum, Aconitum, frondes populeas, and soote.</i>” “℞. <i>Sium,
acarum vulgare, pentaphyllon, the bloud of a flitter-mouse, solanum
somniferum et oleum</i>. They stampe all these togither, and
then they rubbe all parts of their bodies exceedinglie, till they
looke red and be verie hot, so as the pores may be opened
and their flesh soluble and loose. They ioine herewithall
either fat or oile in steed thereof, that the force of the ointment
maie the rather pearse inwardly, and so be more effectual.
By this means (saith he) <i>in a moone light night they seeme to be
carried in the aire, to feasting, singing, dansing, kissing, culling,
and other acts of venerie, with such youthes as they loue and desire
most</i>,” &#38;c. B. x. c. viii. p. 184, ed. 1584.—See the original
of this in Porta’s <i>Magiæ Naturalis, sive De Miraculis Rerum
Naturalium Libri iiii.</i>, 1561, 12mo. p. 180. Porta omitted the
passage in (at least some) later and enlarged editions of his

such other bugs, that we are afraid of our owne shadowes.”
<i>Discouerie of Witchcraft</i>, b. vii. c. xv. p. 153, ed. 1584.—Sir
W. Scott, having given the above quotation from the work of
his namesake, observes: “It would require a better demonologist
than I am to explain the various obsolete superstitions
which Reginald Scot has introduced, as articles of the old
English faith, into the preceding passage. I might indeed
say, the Phuca is a Celtic superstition, from which the word
Pook, or Puckle, was doubtless derived; and I might conjecture,
that the man-in-the-oak was the same with the Erl-König
of the Germans; and that the hellwain were a kind of
wandering spirits, the descendants of a champion named
Hellequin, who are introduced into the romance of Richard
sans Peur. But most antiquarians will be at fault concerning
the spoorn, Kitt-with-the-candlestick, Boneless, and some
others.” <i>Letters on Demonology, &#38;c.</i>, p. 174, sec. ed.—Whatever
“Hellwain” may be properly, Middleton meant to express
by the term some individual spirit: see p. 259, and the
3d scene of act iii.—The words with which Hecate concludes
this speech, “A ab hur hus!” are also borrowed from R. Scot’s
work, b. xii. c. xiv. p. 244, where they are mentioned as a
charm against the toothache.</p>

<p class='c028'>In act iii. sc. 5 of
Davenant’s alteration of <i>Macbeth</i>, this passage is inserted,
with some variations. It is so highly fanciful, and comes
in so happily where Davenant has placed it (viz. immediately

<p class='c022 ti0'>“Though,” says Lamb, “some resemblance may be traced
between the Charms in Macbeth and the Incantations in
this Play, which is supposed to have preceded it, this coincidence
will not detract much from the originality of Shakspeare.
His Witches are distinguished from the Witches of
Middleton by essential differences. These are creatures to
whom man or woman plotting some dire mischief might resort
for occasional consultation. Those originate deeds of
blood and begin bad impulses to men. From the moment
that their eyes first meet with Macbeth’s, he is spell-bound.
That meeting sways his destiny. He can never break the
fascination. These Witches can hurt the body; those have
power over the soul. Hecate in Middleton has a son, a low
buffoon: the hags of Shakspeare have neither child of their
own, nor seem to be descended from any parent. They are
foul Anomalies, of whom we know not whence they are
sprung, nor whether they have beginning or ending. As
they are without human passions, so they seem to be without
human relations. They come with thunder and lightning, and
vanish to airy music. This is all we know of them. Except
Hecate, they have no names; which heightens their mysteriousness.
The names and some of the properties which
Middleton has given to his Hags excite smiles. The Weird
Sisters are serious things. Their presence cannot coexist
with mirth. But, in a lesser degree, the Witches of Middleton
are fine creations. Their power too is, in some measure, over
the mind. They raise jars, jealousies, strifes, <i>like a thick scurf
o’er life</i>.” <i>Spec. of Engl. Dram. Poets</i>, p. 174.</p>

first scene of the second act, are given in the <i>Spec. of Engl.
Dram. Poets</i> by Lamb, whose remarks on them are too weighty
to be omitted here: “The insipid levelling morality to which
the modern stage is tied down would not admit of such admirable
passions as these scenes are filled with. A puritanical
obtuseness of sentiment, a stupid infantile goodness, is creeping
among us, instead of the vigorous passions, and virtues
clad in flesh and blood, with which the old dramatists present
us. Those noble and liberal casuists could discern in the
differences, the quarrels, the animosities of man, a beauty and
truth of moral feeling, no less than in the iterately inculcated
duties of forgiveness and atonement. With us all is hypocritical
meekness. A reconciliation scene (let the occasion
be never so absurd or unnatural) is always sure of applause.
Our audiences come to the theatre to be complimented on
their goodness. They compare notes with the amiable characters
in the play, and find a wonderful similarity of disposition
between them. We have a common stock of dramatic
morality, out of which a writer may be supplied, without the
trouble of copying it from originals within his own breast.
To know the boundaries of honour, to be judiciously valiant,
to have a temperance which shall beget a smoothness in the
angry swellings of youth, to esteem life as nothing when the
sacred reputation of a parent is to be defended, yet to shake
and tremble under a pious cowardice when that ark of an
honest confidence is found to be frail and tottering, to feel
the true blows of a real disgrace blunting that sword which
the imaginary strokes of a supposed false imputation had put
so keen an edge upon but lately; to do, or to imagine this
done in a feigned story, asks something more of a moral
sense, somewhat a greater delicacy of perception in questions
of right and wrong, than goes to the writing of two or three
hackneyed sentences about the laws of honour as opposed to
the laws of the land, or a common-place against duelling. Yet
such things would stand a writer now-a-days in far better
stead than Captain Ager and his conscientious honour; and
he would be considered as a far better teacher of morality
than old Rowley or Middleton if they were living.” P. 136.</p>

“The <i>Passamezzo</i>,” says Sir John Hawkins, “(from
<i>passer</i>, [<i>passare?</i>] to walk, and <i>mezzo</i>, the middle or half,)
is a slow dance, little differing from the action of walking.
As a galliard consists of five paces or bars in the first strain,
and is therefore called a cinque-pace, the <i>passamezzo</i>, which
is a diminutive of the galliard, has just half that number, and
from that peculiarity takes its name.” <i>Hist. of Music</i>, vol. iv.
p. 386. In another place of the same work, vol. ii. p. 134,
Sir John states that “every <i>pavan</i> has its <i>galliard</i>, a lighter
kind of air made out of the former,” which, observes Nares
(<i>Gloss.</i> in v. <i>Pavan</i>), “leads to the suspicion that <i>passy-measure
pavan</i> and <i>passy-measure galliard</i> were correlative terms,
and meant the two different measures of one dance.”</p>

<p class='c052'>The same convention is followed here. Since this version is wider than the
original, most directions are on the same line as the speech.</p>

<p class='c052'>Entrances were centered and separated slightly from lines above and below. This
is rendered here as a full blank line.</p>

<p class='c052'>The footnote scheme used lettered references, repeating a-z. On numerous
occasions, letters were repeated, and sometimes skipped. The numeric
resequencing of notes here resolves those lapses. Footnotes are sometimes
referred to directly in a footnote by its letter designation. The few
direct references to a lettered note use the new numeric value.</p>

<p class='c052'>Footnotes frequently refer to other notes, usually only by referring the
the page where they can be found. Sometimes those cross-references are not
accurate and the correct location cannot be ascertained.  They are left
unlinked.</p>

<p class='c052'>Note 568 (<i>when</i>]) refers to a note on p. 164 of Volume I. The correct reference
is to p. 164 in the current volume.</p>
